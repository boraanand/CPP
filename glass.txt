 Refraction means the bending of a wave resulting from
 a change in its velocity as its moves from one medium
 to another. Since the frequency of a wave cannot 
 change, independent of the source changing its 
 frequency when it originally emits a wave, this change
 in wave velocity must result from a change in its 
 wavelength in the second medium.


 To quantify the degree of refraction, we will
 introduce a dimensionless quantity called the 
 index of refraction, n.

 
                  n = c/v
 
 In this formula,

    * c is the speed of alight in a vacuum, 3 x 108 m/sec
    * v represents the average speed of light in the 
        optically dense medium
    * n is the medium's index of refraction

 



 This defining formula can be easily modified to 
 describe the changes that occur in wavelength during 
 refraction.
 
      n =  c/v
      n =  (fxwavelength)/(fxwavelength in medium)
      n =  wavelength/wavelength in medium
 
 Notice that the frequency, f, cancels since it is an 
 invariant and does not depend on the medium through
 which the wave is traveling.






 Some common indices of refraction for a midrange 
 wavelength of light (589 nm, a prominent line in 
 the emission spectrum of sodium) are:
 

 vacuum - 1.00000  , fused quartz - 1.46 

 air(STP) - 1.00029 , crown glass - 1.52

 water(20ºC) - 1.33 , polystyrene - 1.55

 acetone - 1.36 , carbon disulfide - 1.63

 ethyl alcohol - 1.36 , flint glass (heavy) - 1.65

 sugar solution(30%) - 1.38 , sapphire - 1.77

 sugar solution(80%) - 1.49 , diamond - 2.42
