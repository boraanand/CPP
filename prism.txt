 

 In optics, a prism is a transparent optical element 
 with flat, polished surfaces that refract light.
 The exact angles between the surfaces depend on 
 the application.The traditional geometrical shape is that of 
 a triangular prism with a triangular base and rectangular 
 sides, and in colloquial use "prism" usually refers 
 to this type. Some types of optical prism are not in fact 
 in the shape of geometric prisms. Prisms are typically 
 made out of glass, but can be made from any material 
 that is transparent to the wavelengths for which 
 they are designed.
