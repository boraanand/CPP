 Rules of reflection for concave mirrors are:

 1)Any incident ray traveling parallel to the principal axis
 on the way to the mirror will pass through the focal
 point upon reflection.

 2)Any incident ray passing through the focal point on 
 the way to the mirror will travel parallel to the principal
 axis upon reflection.

 The focal point is the point in space at which light 
 incident towards the mirror and traveling parallel to 
 the principal axis will meet after reflection. 
 The diagram at the right depicts this principle. 
 In fact, if some light from the Sun was collected by a 
 concave mirror, then it would converge at the focal 
 point. Because the Sun is such a large distance from
 the Earth, any light rays from the Sun which strike the 
 mirror will essentially be traveling parallel to the 
 principal axis. As such, this light should reflect through
 the focal point. Perhaps you remember the outdoors 
 demonstration in which a pencil was engulfed in flames
 in a matter of seconds when placed at the focal point of 
 the demonstration mirror. In the demonstration, 
 whatever light from the Sun which hit the mirror was 
 focused at the point where the pencil was. 
 To the surprise of many, the heat was sufficient 
 to ignite the pencil. Wow!
